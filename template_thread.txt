[size=12]Welcome to the BGG Star Realms League!
This thread is for the ${season} season of play.
The league rules can be found in the first post of the [thread=1354680]main announcement thread[/thread].  Here are some basic reminders:


Every player should subscribe not only to their own divisional thread, but also to the [thread=1354680]main announcement thread[/thread].  This is the [i]only[/i] place that we will post notification about upcoming seasons.  Additionally, [b]if any player fails to thumb or post in this thread before the start of round 3, that player is liable to be removed from the league without notice[/b] (unless we have received prior notification).

[b]If you anticipate being unavailable or on vacation in the next month, please notify your division commissioner as soon as possible.[/b]

Every match in this league is one game.
