# Ratings

An explanation of the rating system used for the league.
{:.lead}

If you look up [lifetime rankings](/rankings.html) or individual player
statistics, you'll notice that each player is assigned a **rating.** That value
estimates a player's skill as measured by his performance in league matches.

The rating system currently in use is the
[TrueSkill](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/)
system as implemented by
[Heungsub Lee's TrueSkill package](http://trueskill.org/).
