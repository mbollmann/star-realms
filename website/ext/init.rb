# = webgen extensions directory
#
# All init.rb files anywhere under this directory are automatically
# loaded. This allows you to add your own extensions to webgen or to
# modify webgen's core.
#
# If you don't need this feature you can savely delete this file and the
# directory in which it is!
#
# * For information on how to write extensions, have a look at the API
#   documentation of webgen at
#
#     http://webgen.gettalong.org/documentation/reference/api/
#
# * Have a look at the API documentation of Webgen::BundlerLoader to see
#   what methods are available in init.rb files.
